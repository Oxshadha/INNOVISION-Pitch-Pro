# Pitch Pro â€“ Autonomous Outdoor Line Painting Robot

## Description

Pitch Pro is a microcontroller-based autonomous robot designed to paint precise straight and curved lines on outdoor surfaces such as sports fields and construction sites. Developed by first-year undergraduates, this system uses Arduino Mega and ESP32 boards for distributed task management. The robot focuses on achieving maximum precision for rectangle and square line painting using PID control for straight lines and 90-degree turn correction with a 2-attempt loop system.

The robot is capable of drawing predefined shapes (straight lines, circles, rectangles, squares) and features GPS tracking for path visualization on the web interface. It integrates sensor feedback, paint level monitoring, and obstacle detection to ensure reliable operation on outdoor terrain.
